# Analyzing LastFM Songs using PySpark

This project is a beginner hands-on of analyzing data from distributed sources, a must-have skill for a Data Analyst or Scientist. 
Using PySpark, I analyzed songs users have listened to on LastFM.

Using Google Colab environment, I ran some basic queries to extract meaningful data and ultimately create a few visualizations.
